I had to tweak the exercise.

My usual team-ce ORG, pulumi repo IAC and AWS did not work.

What i am considering doing ?
1. repo under pulumi-demo github org : DONE https://github.com/pulumi/3_github_actions

2. update existing role on pulumi-ce aws account with following audience, trust relation
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::052848974346:oidc-provider/api.pulumi.com/oidc"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "api.pulumi.com/oidc:aud": [
						"team-ce",
						"aws:team-ce",
						"demo", #added new 
						"aws:demo" ##  added new 
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

3. pulumi cloud under demos org : created env, with iam role arn rference

4. update the github/workflows/pulumi.yaml
